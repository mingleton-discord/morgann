                    Rosetta is a brand-new form of communicating with bots that Morgann has pioneered since his inception. It is designed to allow for more semantic communication - that is, talking to Morgann should feel more like talking to another person than talking to a bot.

                    **That being said, there are some things to keep in mind:**
                     ‚Ä¢ Every message must contain the word ‚ÄúMorgann‚Äù, or @mention Morgann for him to detect it.
                     ‚Ä¢ Morgann will recognise Discord objects (@mentions, #channels, etc.), so be sure to properly format them. 
                     ‚Ä¢ Nested text chunks (such as quotes or insults) must be placed within ‚Äúdouble quotations‚Äù so that Morgann can find them properly.\
