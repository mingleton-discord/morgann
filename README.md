# Morgann
This project contains legacy source code for the Morgann Discord bot. Among other things, it was designed to programmatically insult targeted users and store quotes. Most fields are modifiable by server moderators and users, and all server-specific information is limited to that server.

This project worked with a connected PostGreSQL server hosted on Heroku, however the data and structure of this server is no longer known and would need to be reverse engineered.
